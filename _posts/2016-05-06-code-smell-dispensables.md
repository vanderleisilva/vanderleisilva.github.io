We struggle daily to find ways to reduce code complexity, than in order to response an hypothetical future needed we just start working in the opposite way. Do not do that! You Are not Gonna Need It

Dispensable

A dispensable is something irrelevant and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient, easier to understand and mainly is a great time saving!

It's one of the easiest understanding code smell, and at the same time, one of the most common. It's composed by Speculative Generality, Dead Code, Duplicate Code, Data class and Lazy class.

Lights on that we're about to start our trip into Code More and Do Less!
